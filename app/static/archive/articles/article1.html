<h3>Prajna Pravah workshop on Education</h3>

<p>A two-days workshop organized by Prajna Pravah, which took place in Delhi, was attended by over 721 academicians and experts including 51 Vice Chancellors of various central and state universities. The concept of the event was to discuss on the topic of making Indian education more inclined towards the ‘Bharatiya perspectives’.</p>

<p>The workshop called Gyan Sangam was organised by a Sangh backed initiative called Prajna Pravah whose chief speaker on Sunday was Mohan Bhagwat.The audience of the workshop included chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research chairman Y Sudershan Rao, senior RSS functionaries Sahkarvayah Krishna Gopal and Suresh Soni, principal of Brihan Maharashtra Commerce College, Pune Anirudh Deshpande, Indologist Acharya Vamdev Shastri (David Frawley), and Dr Manohar Shinde, founder director Dharma Civilization Foundation USA, and other senior academicians.</p>

<p>The elementary aim of the workshop was to mould the current academic system of India into that of a more ‘Bharatiya’ view, following the government’s consent. The workshop stressed on the point of that there is lack of ‘Indian-ness’ in the education system. RSS Chief Bhagwat also said that ‘Indianisation’ of education is something which should be implemented on an urgent basis without delay.</p>

<p>The workshop was divided in three parts and there were parallel sessions where the academicians discussed “content, contemporary trends and challenges in their respective discipline.” The expert sessions were on different themes – “Cultural Onslaught” was addressed by co-convenor of Swadeshi Jagran Manch S Gurumurthy, and chaired by the Vice Chancellor of Banaras Hindu University Dr GC Tripathi. Bhagwat addressing the crowd said,  “This is not the alternative but the real attempt to develop a Bharatiya perspective.”</p>

<p>“Our education was marked with the absence of Indian-ness. The centre of gravity of our education system shifted towards the west. This is not the government work because our system of education was independent of government control. There was society taking care of it. This should be out of sarkari tantra,” he said.</p>

<p>The event held over the weekend will be followed by many such programs that will be held in various other states in India.</p>
