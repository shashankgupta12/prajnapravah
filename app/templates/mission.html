                        The oceanic congregation of intellectuals in India emanate from individual channels of knowledge, which eventually imbibe greatness as they meet and merge with the cause of humanity and nationalism. From the very ancient times, Bharath had been the <span class="text-danger"><i><strong>gravitational center of intellectualism</i></strong></span>. However, repeated territorial conquests in different forms injected venom in the nation’s backbone, thereby rigidly distorting physicality, mentality and morality of an individual and therefore, the country as a whole. Though, with our united resistance through physical efforts, we have been able to combat the conquerors on armory ground; but failed to completely wipe off their deep rooted impact from the social arena. This not only has contaminated the cultural discourse but also infested our intellectual stream. The right way to defeat such elements is definitely not with ammunition, as they continuously tend to change their appearance, making it difficult to track them down. The solution to get through such challenge is self- realization. It is this realization that would make our brain churn to understand the underlying organization of the invaders and their belief system. In general, whenever a change is expected, it is the sequence of events in a system that needs to be transformed or amended. For bringing out a revolutionary change in the system, requires trust, respect and support from peers.

                        In Bharath, there is a very popular saying that we enjoy unity in diversity. However, this is wrongly quoted as there is one almighty and the nature is a reflection of that supreme power into many forms, i.e. diverse <span class="text-danger"><i><strong>forms of one-ness</i></strong></span>. Similarly, there has been an upcoming trend of fouling the basic usage of words. For instance, whatever regarded as tradition is outdated and is opposed to modernity. Some British officials nomenclatured our historical journey into three phases: Hindu, Muslim and British-powered reigns. After independence, the period marked by Hindu-rich cultures and traditions was regarded as ‘Ancient’, Muslim-reign became ‘Medieval’ and British-rule was proudly manifested as ‘Modern’.

                    <p class="text-justify wow fadeInUp ourVisionText">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                        In our country, the sense of devotion and sacrifice has always been framed in a sequence of higher vision that emanates from individual, family and ancestral-institutions to nation, humanity and God. According to our tradition, acquisition of wealth and desire has always been strictly bounded by Dharma, beyond which aspiration of any form or intensity is Adharma and hence, injustice to mankind and self. Bharath is not just a territory but ‘bearer of knowledge’ that stands firmly on a foundation enriched with cultural one-ness. We have a rich culture of words, tunes, colors and expressions. A culture of words gives birth to wonderful scriptures and literature, culture of tunes springs out into soul refreshing ragas, culture of colors radiates most vivid form of imaginations as paintings; and culture of expression is molded as fantastic forms of dancing moves. Our <span class="text-danger"><i><strong>cultural cosmos</i></strong></span> inherently drives us from Nar to Narayana.    
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="text-justify wow fadeInUp ourVisionText">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                        The present day challenge is to affirm intellectualism in Bharath so as to uproot violence of all forms. Every nation has a core culture that strengthens the bond of nationalism and humanism. This culture is gradually getting wiped off owing to religion-conversions. Such activity not only invades our spiritual tradition but also blocks our awareness and knowledge of our own being. This ultimately calls for <span class="text-danger"><i><strong>decolonizing the mind of our country men</i></strong></span> so that nationalism could resurge with even deeper projection of cultural narratives into our veins. Time has come when western academics needs to get challenged and media monoliths to act in a manner that breeds lesser conflicts on indigenous matters and more on alienated polity of the west.
